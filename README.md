# Daily Word

## General info
* This is a desktop app for Mac that displays a word and its definition once a day
* The goal of the app is to enhance your vocabulary
* Users define the words and their definitions
* At the scheduled time (see below), the Daily Word app opens and initially displays the word only â€” giving you a moment to recall its definition.  Press 'Reveal' to see the definition.

## Installation
* Download the installer [here](https://github.com/timbob04/Daily_word/releases/download/v1.2/Daily.Word.Installer.pkg), or find it in this repo's "Releases" section
* Once installed, the program can be found in the Applications folder
* All accessory files for the program can be found in '~/Library/Application Support/Daily Word'

## Starting the program
* Click on the Daily Word icon in the Applications folder
* You should see a 'DW' icon appear in the Mac's menu bar (next to the Wi-Fi symbol, etc) - this means the program is running
* For the app that opens, enter a time for the daily word to appear and press 'Start'
* A launch agent is created for the program so it keeps running after computer reboot

## Edit the time when the word appears
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the Mac's menu bar and select 'Edit time'

## Edit the word list
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the Mac's menu bar and select 'Edit word list'
* Here you can edit, delete or add words.

## Stopping the program
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the Mac's menu bar and select 'Quit'
* You can also click on the Daily Word icon in the Applications folder and press the 'Stop program' button
* Stopping the program removes the launch agent, so the program will not restart after computer reboot

## Priority words
* You can mark words as 'priority words', either when they appear as the daily word (using the toggle) or in the 'Edit word list' window
* Priority words are displayed below the daily word every day
* The idea is to designate a few select words as priority words, making them appear frequently and thus help with their memorization
