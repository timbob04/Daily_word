# Daily Word

## General info
* This is a desktop app for Mac that displays a word and its definition once a day
* The word is first displayed and then the definition after pressing the 'Reveal' button, to give an opportunity to remember the definition
* Its goal is to enhance your vocabulary
* Users define the words and their definitions

## Installer
* An installer for the program can be found at: https://github.com/timbob04/DailyWordDefinition/releases/tag/v1.0
* Once installed, the program will be in the applications folder
* All accessory files will be placed in '~/Library/Application Support/Daily Word'

## Starting the program
* Click on the Daily Word icon in the applications folder
* You should see a 'DW' icon in the Mac's menu bar (next to the wifi symbol, etc) - this means the program is running
* Enter a time for the daily word to appear and press 'Start'
* A launch agent is created for the program so it keeps running after computer reboot

## Edit the time in which the word appears
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the mac's menu bar and select 'Edit time'

## Edit word list
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the mac's menu bar and select 'Edit word list'
* Here you can edit or delete current words, or add new ones.

## Stopping the program
* Click on the 'DW' icon in the mac's menu bar and select 'Quit'
* You can also click on the Daily Word icon in the applications folder and select 'Stop program'
* Stopping the program removes the launch agent, so the program will not restart after computer reboot

## Priority words
* Mark words as 'priority words' either when they appear as the daily word (using the toggle) or in the 'Edit word list' window
* Priority words are displayed below the daily word
* The idea is to designate a few select words as priority words, making them appear frequently and thus help with their memorization
